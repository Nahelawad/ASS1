        <h1>site report</h1>

        <p>So as we all know I am a beginner software developer, I tried my best to make this portfolio good enough and keep it well organized and capable to the user and to the lecturer to see it and mark it.
            In every thing new in life its ok to face ups and down which I did faced while working in this assignment but its ok every day comes with every new lesson. I have used everything I learned from the lectures and a little extra stuff I searched it and learned it online. As I said I am still a beginner so my site wont be glooming and sparking at first but by time improvement will come and I will do better.
            As for the design I choose the black and gold colours for my website to make it look like a cyberpunk game which I love the same style as it with the same font and look for the game theme.
            I used grid to structure my website as I was taught in the lecture and some keyframes animation for the image to make it look a bit fun for the user to interact with in addition of developing the website for mobile users to use and interact with.
            Its not the perfect website I know but with time I will improve and will do better websites in the future after loads of practice and hard work thank you for visiting my portfolio enjoy your day.
            </p>
